# KuduWorks 🚀

**Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps—minus the boring bits**

Welcome to KuduWorks. We build secure, scalable cloud infrastructure and occasionally rescue confused Terraform states. Coffee optional, good docs mandatory.

## 🎯 What we actually do (and enjoy)

- **Azure cloud architecture** — we design resilient setups that survive coffee spills and Mondays
- **Infrastructure as Code** — Terraform is our paintbrush (and sometimes our hammer)
- **Security & Compliance** — ISO 27001-friendly defaults so auditors smile less and sleep more
- **DevOps automation** — automated VM schedules, deployments, and the occasional scripted wizardry
- **Policy-as-code** — governance that doesn't feel like a footnote

## 📋 Featured project: fictional-octo-system

This is our showcase repo — think of it as the demo kitchen where we try out recipes that scale.

Highlights:
- ✅ Smart IP management for development machines (no more frantic state-lock panic)
- ✅ Private VMs + Azure Bastion (we like secure, boring networks)
- ✅ Automated VM start/stop in Finnish timezone (7AM/7PM — because reasons)
- ✅ ISO 27001-minded: encryption at host and sensible defaults
- ✅ Policy as code for governance and fewer surprises

## 🔧 Our approach (short version)

- **Security first, but not security theater** — use private networks, managed identities, and sane defaults
- **Cost-aware** — automated shutdowns and sensible defaults to avoid surprised bills
- **Readable code** — Terraform modules and wrapper scripts so humans (and future-you) can understand things
- **Ship small, document well** — quick wins > obscure architecture diagrams

## 😎 Why KuduWorks? (tl;dr)

- We deliver pragmatic infra that’s actually maintainable.
- We prefer automation that helps humans, not replaces them.
- We keep things open-source so you can borrow our tricks and roast them if you like.

- File an issue in the repo you like, and we'll pretend to be surprised and then help.
