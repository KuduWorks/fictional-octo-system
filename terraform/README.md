# Terraform Infrastructure for Fictional Octo System

This folder contains Terraform code for deploying and managing Azure resources for the Fictional Octo System project.

## Infrastructure Components

- **Storage Account**: Remote state storage with IP-restricted access
- **Virtual Network**: Basic networking setup with customizable address space
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor setup with Log Analytics Workspace
- **Security**: Network rules limiting storage account access to specified IPs

## File Structure

- `main.tf` â€” Core infrastructure and provider configuration
- `variables.tf` â€” Input variables definition
- `monitoring.tf` â€” Monitoring and alerting configuration
- `storage_network.tf` â€” Storage account network security rules
- `backend.tf` â€” Remote state configuration
- `terraform.tfvars` â€” Variable values (not in version control)

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure CLI** installed and configured
2. **Terraform** (version >= 1.3.0) installed
3. Access to Azure subscription with required permissions

## Getting Started

### ðŸš€ Quick Start with Dynamic IP (Recommended)

If your IP address changes frequently, use the provided wrapper scripts:

**Bash (Linux/macOS/Git Bash):**
```bash
# Make scripts executable (first time only)
chmod +x update-ip.sh tf.sh

# Use wrapper for all Terraform commands
./tf.sh init
./tf.sh plan
./tf.sh apply
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
# Use wrapper for all Terraform commands
.\tf.ps1 init
.\tf.ps1 plan
.\tf.ps1 apply
```

The wrapper automatically updates your IP in the storage account firewall before running Terraform.

ðŸ“– **See [TERRAFORM_STATE_ACCESS.md](./TERRAFORM_STATE_ACCESS.md) for detailed documentation on dynamic IP handling.**

---

### ðŸ“‹ Standard Setup

1. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```powershell
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Configure Variables**
   Create a `terraform.tfvars` file with your values:
   ```hcl
   resource_group_name = "rg-monitoring"
   alert_email = "your.email@domain.com"
   allowed_ip_addresses = ["YOUR.IP.ADDRESS"]
   ```

3. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```powershell
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Security Features

- Storage account access restricted to specified IP addresses
- Azure services bypass enabled for monitoring
- Diagnostic settings configured for auditing
- 30-day retention policy for logs and metrics

## Monitoring Setup

- Log Analytics Workspace for centralized logging
- Storage account metrics collection
- Availability monitoring and alerting
- Email notifications for critical events

## Best Practices

- Store sensitive data in `terraform.tfvars` (not in version control)
- Use Azure CLI authentication
- Keep Terraform provider and Azure RM versions up to date
- Review and adjust monitoring thresholds as needed
